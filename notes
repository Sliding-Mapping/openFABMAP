[60]: cubic time complexity appearance based navigation
Q: linear complexity in what? seems complexity O(is #voc x #location) while #voc is actually a large number?

For bag-of-words model, see video google.
For Chow-Liu treem see [24], for large data see [39] semi-external spanning tree algorithm and [92] sparse and even-large scale data.

WHY equation (3.22) works?

A better data association method, see [129], particle filter

Independent assumptions:
1. Sets of observations are conditionally independent given position: P(Z_k|L_i, Z^{k-1}) = P(Z_k|L_i)
2. Detector behaviour is independent of position: P(z_q|e_q, L_i) = p(z_q|e_q)
3. Location models are generated independently by the environment.

Approximation:
1. The existence of scene element e_q is not informed by observations other than z_q. P(e_q|Z_k) approximates P(e_q|z_{q_k})
2. p(e_q|L_i) approximates P(e_q|z_p, L_i) when p != q

WHAT is precision-recall curve?
precision: ratio of ture positive loop closure detections to total detections
recall: ratio of true positive loop closure detections to the number of ground ruth loop closures
indication: how useful the sysstem would be for loop closure dtection as part of a metric SLAM system -- recall at100% precision indicates the percentage of loop closures that can be detected without any false positives that would cause filter divergence

seems: correction of trajectory [110]

disadvantages of Kalman filter based SLAM: assumption of linearity/ Gaussian noise/

global image representation: sensitive to viewpoint/ light/ perspective variants

interest point detector and local feature descriptor

high dimensional feature vector, hard to compare -> vocabulary tree quantization and bag-of-words model ( use small integer to represent regions where feature vectors fall into )

loop closure: previously localization in a known map and sensory view is guaranteed to come from somewhere within the map --- easy to solve

in SLAM, sensory view might come from (1) previously visited place; or (2) unknow place -> cause of difficulty TO READ [55]

**perceptual aliasing: different parts of the workspace may appear the same to the robot's sensors ( repetitive features like repeating architectual elements, e.g. brick wall, grass )

TO READ: similarity matrix based method
   drawbacks: 
	(1) not truly probabilistic in construction so didn't integrate very smoothly into more general SLAM framework
	(2) O(n^3)

observations do occur together, they are NOT independent

representation of joint probability of n discrete variables without special structure is exponential in n -> to approximate using a distribution with special structure

similarity metric: KL-divergence

approximate methods: 
(1) Naive Bayes -> each variable independent on each other, ability of approximation is limited
(2) each variable relies on at most one other variable -> tree structure, Chow-Liu tree
(3) each variable relies on at most n other variables -> thin junction tree -> NP hard, exist approximate solution

Chow-Liu tree
best tree-structured bayesian network approximating the original distribution in sense of KL-divergence
step#1: construct complete graph, weight of edge: mutual information between two nodes connected by the edge
step#2: find maximum weight spanning tree

reasons of introducing eq:
(1) provide a natural framework to incorporate data from other sensors
(2) facilitate factoring the distribution p(Z|L_i) into 
	simple model of location;
	AND complex model to capture the correlation between detections of appearance workds


p(eq|Li) changes from time to time -> modify the model to adapt to inverted index method



title: Real-Time Visual Loop-Closure Detection

Why would FAB-MAP fail after successfully detecting loop-closure along a long trajectory?
	is it because the of the time complexity?

evaluate FABMAP as "The main asset of this model is its ability to evaluate the distinctiveness of each word, thus accounting for perceptual aliasing at the word level, while its principal drawback lies in the offline process needed for model learning and dictonary computation."

this model is incremental ( construct the vocabulary from time to time) while FABMAP has to compute the dependencies beforehand.

		The relocalisation module (ref: Real-time SLAM relocalisation) determines the pose of the camera relative to a map of point features by finding correspondences between the image and the features in the map. The pose is then determined from the correspondences using R ANSAC and the three–point–pose algorithm.
